# Call Sal Website V2 — Progress

## Session 18 (Feb 5, 2026) — Module Consolidation + Overlays

### Completed
- [x] Created CinematicsModule.tsx (all VideoPortfolio content from Hero.tsx)
- [x] Removed THE SAL METHOD placeholder module
- [x] Consolidated from 3 modules to 2 (Armory + Cinematics)
- [x] Created BookingOverlay.tsx (floating 4-step booking, TVOverlay pattern)
- [x] VIEW CINEMATICS → TVOverlay (quick portfolio view)
- [x] BOOK NOW → BookingOverlay (quick booking)
- [x] Cinematics module card → fullscreen CinematicsModule (deep dive)
- [x] "SO WHO IS THIS SAL GUY ANYWAY?" CTA at bottom of module modals
- [x] Fixed BookingPage wireframe bleed-through (solid bg-black wrapper)
- [x] Build passes clean

### Architecture
- Two hero buttons: VIEW CINEMATICS (cinematicsMode) + BOOK NOW (bookingMode)
- Both overlays: floating panels with mouse parallax, fade hero title, lock scroll
- Module cards: Armory + Cinematics in 3D room, fly-to-fullscreen modal on click
- openModuleId prop: allows programmatic module opening (e.g., from hero)

### Next
- [ ] Visual QA on all overlays and modules
- [ ] Test auth/booking flows end-to-end
- [ ] Performance audit (Lighthouse)
